# AI Context Generation Prompt

## üéØ Primary Objective
Create a comprehensive CLAUDE.md context file by analyzing multiple information sources (Confluence docs, source code, documentation, etc.) to build an optimal AI assistant context for this codebase.

## üìä Context Quality Standards

### Core Quality Principles
1. **No Duplication**: Each piece of information appears only once in its most appropriate section
   - Cross-reference related information instead of repeating
   - Use consistent terminology throughout the document
   - Link to primary definitions rather than re-explaining concepts

2. **Complete Coverage**: All technical details from source files are preserved
   - Verify every critical component is documented
   - Include edge cases and error scenarios
   - Document both happy path and failure modes
   - Preserve implementation-specific details that affect behavior

3. **Quick Lookup**: Clear table of contents and section headers enable fast navigation
   - Use hierarchical structure with predictable naming
   - Include search-friendly keywords in headers
   - Provide cross-references between related sections
   - Create index-style quick reference tables

4. **Concise Format**: Bullet points, tables, and code snippets for fast scanning
   - Prefer structured data over prose where possible
   - Use code blocks for examples and configurations
   - Implement progressive disclosure (summary ‚Üí details)
   - Group related information in tables and lists

5. **Technical Accuracy**: All critical implementation details maintained with verification
   - Cross-reference documentation against actual code
   - Include version-specific information where relevant
   - Validate all code examples and configurations
   - Update context when implementation changes

### Phase 2: Source Code Architecture Analysis
**think deeper** about the codebase structure and implementation:

#### Core Architecture Assessment
```
Analyze and document:
1. **Layered Architecture**: Identify presentation, business, data, and infrastructure layers
2. **Module Organization**: How code is organized (feature-based, layer-based, domain-driven)
3. **Dependency Direction**: Flow of dependencies between modules
4. **Coupling Analysis**: Tight vs loose coupling between components
5. **Cohesion Assessment**: How well-focused each module is on its responsibility
```

#### Design Pattern Analysis
```
Identify and document patterns used:
- **Creational**: Factory, Builder, Singleton implementations
- **Structural**: Adapter, Decorator, Facade patterns
- **Behavioral**: Observer, Strategy, Command patterns
- **Architectural**: MVC, MVP, Repository, Service Layer
- **Anti-patterns**: God objects, Circular dependencies, Feature envy
```

#### Data Flow Architecture
```
Map data movement through the system:
1. **Request/Response Flow**: HTTP requests ‚Üí Controllers ‚Üí Services ‚Üí Data layer
2. **State Management**: How application state is managed and synchronized
3. **Event Flow**: Event-driven architectures, message passing, callbacks
4. **Data Transformation**: Where and how data is transformed between layers
5. **Error Propagation**: How errors bubble up through the system
```

#### Performance Metrics & Benchmarks
```
Document actual system performance data:
1. **Load Test Results**: Real performance numbers with concurrent users, RPS, error rates
2. **Resource Usage**: Memory consumption, CPU utilization, disk I/O patterns
3. **Response Times**: 95th percentile, average, and worst-case scenarios
4. **Throughput Limits**: Maximum sustained load before degradation
5. **Scaling Characteristics**: How performance changes with load/data size
6. **Bottleneck Analysis**: Identified constraints and their impact
```

#### Critical Dependencies Assessment
```
Analyze dependency landscape:
- **Core Dependencies**: Framework dependencies that define architecture
- **Business Dependencies**: Libraries that implement business logic
- **Infrastructure Dependencies**: Database, caching, message queues
- **Development Dependencies**: Testing, building, linting tools
- **Circular Dependencies**: Identify and document circular references
- **Coupling Metrics**: Measure afferent/efferent coupling
```

### Phase 3: Quality & Pain Point Analysis
**think harder** about code quality and potential issues:

#### Code Quality Assessment
```
Evaluate codebase health:
1. **SOLID Principles Violations**:
   - Single Responsibility: Classes/functions doing too much
   - Open/Closed: Hard to extend without modification
   - Liskov Substitution: Inheritance hierarchy issues
   - Interface Segregation: Fat interfaces
   - Dependency Inversion: Concrete dependencies

2. **Code Smells Detection**:
   - Long methods/classes
   - Duplicate code
   - Large parameter lists
   - Feature envy
   - Data clumps
   - Primitive obsession

3. **Technical Debt Hotspots**:
   - Legacy code sections
   - Missing tests
   - Outdated dependencies
   - Performance bottlenecks
   - Security vulnerabilities
```

#### Scalability Analysis
```
Identify scaling bottlenecks:
1. **Performance Bottlenecks**:
   - Database query patterns
   - N+1 query problems
   - Memory leaks
   - CPU-intensive operations
   - Synchronous blocking operations

2. **Architectural Constraints**:
   - Monolithic vs microservice boundaries
   - Database scalability limits
   - Session management approaches
   - Caching strategies
   - Load balancing considerations

3. **Resource Limitations**:
